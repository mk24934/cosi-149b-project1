Starting with OpenCV Text Detection for videos as our base file, we grabbed parts of OpenCV's Text Recognition and put it in the code video text detection python code.  This allowed us to print out what was being detected.  Following this we filtered out the noise such that only the room number is displayed.  At the moment only the first room sign is accurately detected and recognized, more work to be done.
